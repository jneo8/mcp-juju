# SPEC-0: MCP Juju Server - Introduction and Overview

## Problem Statement

Production Juju environments require expert-level knowledge for deployment, troubleshooting, and day-to-day management. Organizations running critical workloads on Juju face significant operational challenges:

- **Production Complexity**: Real-world Juju deployments involve complex multi-application topologies, cross-model relations, and intricate scaling scenarios that require deep expertise to manage effectively
- **Troubleshooting Expertise Gap**: When production issues arise (application failures, charm errors, scaling problems), teams often lack the specialized Juju knowledge needed for rapid diagnosis and resolution
- **24/7 Operations**: Production environments require around-the-clock monitoring and management, but Juju expertise is scarce and expensive to maintain on-call
- **Knowledge Silos**: Juju operational knowledge is typically concentrated in a few senior engineers, creating bottlenecks and single points of failure for critical operations
- **AI Assistant Limitations**: Current AI assistants can provide general Juju advice but cannot directly interact with live production environments to perform actual deployments, diagnostics, or remediation

Organizations need AI assistants that can act as expert Juju operators - capable of directly managing production deployments, diagnosing real issues, and executing complex operational workflows with the same expertise as seasoned Juju specialists.

## Goals

### Phase 1: Stdio Protocol Support
- Expose all Juju CLI commands as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Enable AI assistants to help common Juju users perform operations (deploy, scale, configure)
- Lower the barrier to entry for new Juju users through natural language interaction
- Support stdio transport mode for maximum compatibility
- Maintain full compatibility with Juju 3.6

### Phase 2: Resource Subscription
- Implement MCP resource templates and subscription mechanisms
- Dynamic resource discovery and real-time updates
- Support for Juju status monitoring and event streaming
- Enhanced observability through structured resource data

### Phase 2.5: Observer Mode
- Real-time monitoring of Juju operations through MCP resource subscriptions
- Proactive warning system for detecting potential issues before they become critical
- Continuous observation of charm status, resource utilization, and application health
- Intelligent alerting for configuration drift, scaling needs, and maintenance windows
- Non-intrusive monitoring that provides insights without performing operations

### Phase 3: HTTP Server & Authorization
- Add HTTP transport mode with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Role-based access control for MCP tool operations
- Integration with Canonical Identity Platform for seamless Ubuntu ecosystem authentication
- Audit logging and compliance features

## Future Goals

- **Expert-Level Tools**: Provide advanced tools and resources beyond CLI limitations for sophisticated Juju operations
- **AI-Based Operation Platform**: Serve as a core component of the Juju ecosystem for building AI-driven infrastructure management platforms
- **Deep Integration**: Native integration with Juju internals, APIs, and ecosystem components beyond command-line interfaces
- **Intelligent Automation**: Advanced AI capabilities for autonomous infrastructure management, predictive maintenance, and self-healing systems

## Non-Goals

- **Juju Core Modification**: This project does not modify Juju itself, only provides an MCP interface
- **Authentication Management**: Does not replace or modify Juju's existing authentication mechanisms
- **Alternative CLI**: Not intended as a replacement for the official Juju CLI
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Phase 1 focuses exclusively on Juju 3.6

## Introduction

Juju is Ubuntu's application modeling tool that enables the deployment and management of complex distributed applications across multiple cloud platforms. It uses charms (packages that contain deployment logic) to deploy and configure applications, and models to organize and manage related applications.

### Current Workflow

Traditional Juju management involves:

1. **Manual CLI Operations**: Operators use `juju` commands directly
2. **Documentation Lookup**: Frequent reference to command documentation
3. **Trial and Error**: Testing command combinations for complex operations
4. **Script Development**: Writing bash scripts for repetitive tasks

```bash
# Example traditional workflow
juju bootstrap aws my-controller
juju add-model production
juju deploy postgresql --channel 14/stable
juju deploy wordpress --channel latest/stable
juju integrate wordpress postgresql
juju expose wordpress
```

### AI-Enhanced Workflow

With the MCP Juju Server, production teams can interact naturally with their Juju infrastructure:

**Natural Language to Production Actions:**
- **"Deploy our e-commerce stack to AWS with high availability"** → AI orchestrates multi-application deployment with proper scaling and monitoring
- **"Why is the database slow?"** → AI analyzes charm status, resource metrics, and configuration to identify performance bottlenecks  
- **"Scale the web tier to handle traffic spike"** → AI safely scales applications while maintaining integrations and health checks
- **"Update PostgreSQL charm to latest stable"** → AI plans and executes rolling updates during maintenance windows

This transforms Juju management from command-line expertise to conversational operations, enabling teams to focus on business outcomes rather than infrastructure complexity.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Production Emergency Response
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer managing critical e-commerce infrastructure  
**I want** an AI assistant that can immediately diagnose and resolve production Juju issues at 3 AM  
**So that** I can maintain 99.99% uptime without requiring senior Juju experts on-call 24/7

**Scenario**: "Our payment processing service went down during Black Friday. The Juju model shows multiple applications in error state. I need the AI to quickly identify the root cause, determine if it's a charm issue, configuration problem, or infrastructure failure, and execute the appropriate recovery steps - all while I'm coordinating with business stakeholders."

### Story 2: Complex Production Deployment
**As a** Platform Engineering Team Lead  
**I want** an AI that can orchestrate sophisticated multi-region deployments with cross-model relations  
**So that** junior engineers can safely deploy complex services without deep Juju expertise

**Scenario**: "Deploy our new microservices architecture across 3 regions with proper data replication, load balancing, and disaster recovery. The deployment involves 15+ charms, cross-model integrations, and specific networking requirements. The AI should handle the orchestration, validate configurations, and ensure all health checks pass before marking deployment complete."

### Story 3: Proactive Production Management
**As a** DevOps Manager overseeing multiple production environments  
**I want** an AI that continuously monitors Juju deployments and takes preventive actions  
**So that** we can prevent outages before they impact customers and reduce manual operational overhead

**Scenario**: "In Observer Mode, continuously monitor our 50+ production applications across different clouds through real-time MCP resource subscriptions. When the AI detects early warning signs (charm hooks failing, resource constraints, scaling issues), it should provide proactive warnings with detailed analysis before issues become critical. The AI should alert the team with specific remediation recommendations, and for routine maintenance like charm updates, it should identify optimal maintenance windows and prepare execution plans."

### Story 4: Expert Knowledge Transfer
**As a** Senior Juju Architect preparing for retirement  
**I want** to encode my 5+ years of production Juju experience into an AI assistant  
**So that** the organization retains critical operational knowledge and new team members can benefit from expert-level guidance

**Scenario**: "The AI should understand our specific deployment patterns, know which charm configurations work best for our workloads, recognize common failure modes in our environment, and provide the same level of troubleshooting insight I would. When new engineers ask questions like 'Why is PostgreSQL performing poorly?' it should know to check specific metrics, configuration parameters, and infrastructure constraints relevant to our setup."
